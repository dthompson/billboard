# Billboard

    Hold on one second, buddy. Let me see something here.
    Boy, I am good. I commandeered your screens.
    I need them. Time for a little transparency.
    - Tony Stark

Got screens in your home or office? Wish you could magically zap stuff onto them? Here's an API for that.

Simply open a unique URL in a fullscreen web browser on as many or as few screens as you'd like, and issue calls to the  Billboard API. Your content will appear on the screens you've specified, through the magic of node.js and Socket.io.

## Setup 

1. Deploy a copy of Billboard to a location of your choice. (We like Heroku.)
2. On a computer connected to a screen, open the following URL: http://{host_location}/screens/{screen_name_of_your_choice}. (We suggest using Google Chrome in fullscreen mode.)
3. Repeat Step 2 for as many screens as you have. 
4. Issue calls to the API (see below) and your content appears.

## API Usage

    }
```
